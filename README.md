A nice website that allows a user to purchase movie tickets from the  flatiron movie theater.

This is an application, Flatdango, that allows a user to purchase movie tickets from the theater.

It dislplays the movie's details which includes its :
>poster 
>title 
>runtime,
>showtime 
>available tickets 
when the page loads. 

The number of available tickets is derived by subtracting the number of `tickets_sold` from the theater's `capacity`.

After the user buys a ticket the number of tickets reduce and when it reaches (0), the tickets are declared to be soldout!
